<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

A simple Game Shop website built with React. I have followed the tutorial of <a href= 'https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/'> Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller</a> to build the frontend. For now, I am only working on the dynamic frontend of the site. I plan to implement `MERN` stack to configure the backend soon along with a DB.
